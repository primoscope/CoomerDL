# Roadmap and Readme Improver

This microagent is designed to check for any improvements left on roadmap or readme files and improve them.

## Capabilities
- Analyze `ROADMAP.md` or similar roadmap files for pending items or outdated information.
- Analyze `README.md` files for clarity, completeness, and accuracy.
- Suggest and implement improvements to these files.

## Usage
This agent does not have specific triggers and is intended to be used when general improvement of documentation is needed or when explicitly invoked by the user to check these files.

## Instructions
1.  **Check Roadmap:** Look for `ROADMAP.md` or similar files. Identify items that might be completed but not marked, or areas where the roadmap can be clarified.
2.  **Check Readme:** Look for `README.md` files. Ensure installation instructions, usage examples, and project descriptions are up-to-date and easy to understand.
3.  **Improve:** Make edits to these files to enhance their quality and accuracy.
